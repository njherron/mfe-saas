:toc:
:toclevels: 2

This repository is a learning project inspired by the Udemy course on Micro Frontends, available at https://bah.udemy.com/course/microfrontend-course/learn/lecture/23207130. It demonstrates how to build and integrate multiple micro frontends into a cohesive application using **Single-SPA**.

== Overview

The project explores the concepts of **Micro Frontends (MFE)** and **Single-SPA**, showcasing how to structure, develop, and deploy multiple micro frontends. Each micro frontend is built with different frameworks and technologies, working together seamlessly.

=== Key Features

- **React-based components** for the container and marketing app.
- **Single-SPA integration** to manage multiple micro frontends.
- **Material-UI** for consistent styling across applications.
- **Routing** with `react-router-dom` for navigation between pages.
- **Dynamic module loading** to mount and unmount micro frontends.

== Project Structure

- `container/`: The main application that serves as the shell for the micro frontends.
- `marketing/`: A micro frontend that serves as the marketing page.
- `auth/`: (Optional) A placeholder for an authentication micro frontend.
- `dashboard/`: Simulation of the actual product this fake SaaS provides.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

=== Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:njherron/mfe-saas.git

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
